**History of Codechat**
------------------------
Code Chat converts source code into a web page, allowing developers to view their program as a descriptive document by adding headings, formatting, hyperlinks, diagrams, images, and other varieties of content to capture the ideas and insights that innately flow from the programming process. It also gives you a clean canvas on which to plan ahead, whether you're sketching out an algorithm before committing it to code or laying out a design document that can change with the code. By combining ideas with their implementation as code, this literate programming paradigm improves the way developers think, substantially boosting a programmer's abilities. The idea of this is that great programmers are able to write detailed explanations of their code so that anyone could understand the information being presented to them.
