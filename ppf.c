*Past*
------------
**Development**
=================
We came up with the concept to build this website because we recognized a need for a single textbook that had all of the links and material for this course. Because this is the first semester that this course has been offered, students may find it challenging to grasp some aspects of the class at first, such as the format and spacing in the code chat software. This guide was intended to assist you in navigating the classÂ materials and serves as a general overview of everything you will learn.

*Present*
----------------------
**Format of this E-book**
==========================
*  The walkthrough html page that explains the information that will be covered in the codechat course (insert link)
*   The jeopardy game interactive game that will test your knowledge of what you read in the walkthrough

Future
------------------
**End Goal**
===============
Thor will move on this map that has the coordinates of 40 wide by 18 high. As the light of power changes locations your goal is change the direction of Thor's movements based on the coordinate placement of the light of power.


*Note: You can utilize any coding language that you are most comfortable with to write this code by changing this option in the code tab. I chose to use C++*
