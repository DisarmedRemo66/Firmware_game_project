**Development**
=================
We came up with the concept to build this website because we recognized a need for a single textbook that had all of the links and material for this course. Because this is the first semester that this course has been offered, students may find it challenging to grasp some aspects of the class at first, such as the format and spacing in the code chat software. This guide was intended to assist you in navigating the classÂ materials and serves as a general overview of everything you will learn.

*Present*
----------------------
**Format of this E-book**
==========================
*  The walkthrough html page that explains the information that will be covered in the codechat `course <insert link)>`_
*   The jeopardy game interactive game that will test your knowledge of what you read in the walkthrough

Future
------------------
**End Goal**
===============
We hope to make the features of the Jeopardy game multiplayer and able to keep track of the players score. Also with the future development of this course we hope more guidebooks can be added for Github and trouble shooting.
